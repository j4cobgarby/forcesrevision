                What is the resultant force?

            <div class="contents">
                Basically, the resultant force on an object is <b>the sum of all
                the forces acting upon it.</b><br />
                This is useful to know, since this single force has the same
                physical effect on the object as all of the others (as would
                be expected.) <br><br />

        <div class="container">
            <div class="header">Zero resultant force</div>
            <div class="contents">
                Although unlikely to actually happen <i>perfectly</i> in the
                real world, the resultant force on an object can be 0. This
                can happen if there are two forces on an object, both from
                opposite sides to each, and <b>both of the same force.</b><br /><br>
                <img src="assets/resultantforce/zero.png" alt="Zero resultant force"><br />
                The effects of this are as follows:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>If the object was already moving, it will now move
                    in the direction it was already moving, but at a constant
                    speed.</li>
                    <li>
                        Or, <b>if the resultant force is not 0</b>, the object
                        will either speed up or slow down, depending on the
                        size of each force.
                    </li>
                </ul>
