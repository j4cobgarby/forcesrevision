            <div class="contents">
                Every moving object has momentum. (Photons are interesting in
                this respect, since they <b>do</b> have momentum, but have no
                mass. There's an interesting discussion about this <a class="black" href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/2229/if-photons-have-no-mass-how-can-they-have-momentum">here.</a>)<br>
                Anyway, every object has momentum since:<br><br>
                <code>Momentum (kg m/s) = mass (kg) Ã— velocity (m/s)</code><br><br>
                Momentum is <b>an object's ability to continue moving in the same
                direction</b>, after it's been pushed, etc.br
                From the above equation, you can see that momentum has both
                magnitude <i>and</i> direction, extended from the velocity; the
                magnitude comes from the mass.

            <div class="header">Conservation of Momentum</div>
            <div class="contents">
                In either a collision or an explosion, so long as no external
                forces are acting upon the object, its momentum remains the same.
                This is called the <i>conservation of momentum</i>.<br><br>

                You can use this equation triangle to calculate the momentum,
                velocity or mass of any object, if you know the other two!
