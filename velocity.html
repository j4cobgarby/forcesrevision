            <div class="contents">
                One way of describing velocity, in a three-dimensional world,
                is a three-dimensional vector describing its direction and
                magnitude. This is because the velocity of an object is <b>the
                speed of that object in a certain direction.</b><br>
                One can plot a graph of the velocity of an object by plotting
                its velocity in a given direction against the time. Usually,
                it will look similar to this.<br><br>

                As annotated on the graph:<br />
                Whenever a line in a velocity-time graph is <i>perfectly</i>
                straight (unlikely in the real world), the object is either:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moving at a constant speed, or</li>
                    <li>Accelerating or decelerating constantly</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="header">Calculating acceleration</div>
            <div class="contents">
                Acceleration, put simply, is a change in velocity. An object's
                acceleration changes when either
                <ul>
                    <li>Its speed changes, and/or</li>
                    <li>Its direction changes</li>
                </ul>
                Since both of these events change the object's velocity.<br>
