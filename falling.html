                For the intents and purpose of this website, there are two forces
                which affect the speed of a falling object, which are
                <ul>
                    <li>the air resistance on the object, and</li>
                    <li>the weight of the object, affected by gravity.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="header">The stages of falling</div>
            <div class="contents">
                When an object falls, it goes through three different stages
                before it hits the ground.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        First, <b>the object accelerates</b>. This is because of its
                        weight, creating a resultant force in the down direction.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then, the air resistance increase. Its weight remains the
                        same, but <b>it doesn't accelerate so quickly</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The weight then becomes <i>cancelled out</i> by the air
                        resistance, resulting in <b>no resultant force</b>, which
                        is called <b>terminal velocity</b>.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <div class="header">Air Resistance</div>
            <div class="contents">
                Air resistance has a huge effect on falling objects. In a vacuum
                (where there's no air resistance,) a feather and a coin will fall
                at the same speed, however with air resistance, the coin will
                fall faster.<br>
                This is because the air resistance acting on the coin has to be
                a lot more than on the feather, to slow it down.
